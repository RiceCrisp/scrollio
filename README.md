# Scrollio

## A library for animating elements based on their screen position

### Getting Started

Include this library into your project via html:

```
<script src="scrollio.js"></script>
```

Or install via npm:

```
npm install scrollio
```

Then initialize the library:

```
import Scrollio from scrollio

const scrollio = new Scrollio()
```

If you want the library to only target a specific HTML element and it's children, then pass it as an argument:

```
const scrollio = new Scrollio(document.querySelector('.selected-element'))
```
